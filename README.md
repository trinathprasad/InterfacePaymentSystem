# InterfacePaymentSystem

A simple Java console-based project that demonstrates how to design a payment system using **interfaces** and **polymorphism**.  
This project simulates a shopping cart where users can choose from multiple payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI) and process transactions using a unified interface.
